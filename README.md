### Some notes about using the eventbrite python script:
  * the main function is getEventsIntoCSV(startDate, endDate, freeEventsOnly, ApproxNumEvents);
  * another key function may be isAppropriateForYouth, in which you can specify certain 'bad' keywords. If an event contains any of those keywords, it will not be written to the csv.
